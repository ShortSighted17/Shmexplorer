This is a small and primitive browser, made following this book: https://browser.engineering/index.html  
It might not be the browser you need, but it's the browser you deserve  

if you feel like checking out the progress download the files and run:  
"python3 Shmexplorer_v1.py" for a default page im using to debug  
or  
"python3 Shmexplorer_v1.py https://fill-in-url.com"  
please keep in mind this is an ongoing project.
